<h2><center>Goal</h2></center>

My goal for this module was to use a novel and find words that resulted in a pattern.  I decided to use the novel <em>Cold Mountain</em> by Charles Frazier.  This novel contains a pattern of parallelism of the two main characters, Inman and Ada. 

<h2><center>Outcome</h2></center>
<p>  I found a <a href="https://1.cdn.edl.io/2pFtCNn2dVW8oUhK6QlcokDUm0p4YWD6KirOt0pqqmdjVvCs.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> of the novel online, and I received very interesting results from Voyant.

<p>

According to Voyant, the most frequent words that appeared in this PDF are "said" (1,052 times), "Inman" (971 times), "Ada" (679 times), "man" (451), and "like" (422 times).  Not surprisingly, Inman and Ada would be on the top of the list of most frequent words.  Since the story is mostly about Inman taking a long perilous journey to return back home to Ada, his name appears more than Ada's.  Interestingly, the word "said" was the most frequented word because Frazier's writing style does not contain quotation marks for character dialogue.

What struck me the most were the Chinese letters and the number 232 that both appeared 232 times.  It occurred to me that Voyant did not exactly track words exclusively from the PDF, but also the words from the publication company.  The Chinese letters and the number 232 appear on every page of the PDF.  Since there are 232 pages, that explains the 232 occurrences.  I found these data collections much more interesting because it appears that Voyant collected data from words and symbols that were not actually from the text, but rather the repeated consistant symbols from each page.  Even "20Charles" (a segment of the URL at the bottom of each page of the PDF) was recorded 232 times.

It appears that the graph's nature of the most frequented words also has its own pattern.  For instance, at documents segments 5 and 6, the word "man" and "Ada" seem to have almost a balanced usage of data.  The lines almost look like a perfect figure 8. Regarding parallelism, this can represent Ada waiting for Inman's arrival, or she may be thinking about the other male characters she knows about.  While the word "said" has the most fluctuation, the overall graph appears to be a visual of what the title is - mountains.  When I saw the data, I thought it looked very similar to a mountain range with a valley.

<center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center>

The Text Analysis module provided me with many observations that I can easily overlook in terms of collecting data from a PDF copy of a novel.  I really enjoyed using this tool because I liked its functionality as it was demonstrated in class.  I did not think the majority of my findings would result in a mere collection from words and symbols that actually appear on every page rather than words from the novel.  One key aspect from this project is to keep in mind that if you want to analyze the text of a document using Voyant, be sure that extraneous and repetitive information such as the publishing company, page numbers, or a URL do not appear on every single page, or you will have to filter them out of the results.
